## We can create `create-react-app` with the following command:

> npx create-react-app help-queue

### To use the same version as Epicodus's curricilum, `cd` into any project you create and run the following command: 

> npm install --save-exact react-scripts@3.2.0

#### Then delete content inside the `App.js` file (but not the file itself). We can also delete the `App.css` and `App.test.js` files that `create-react-app` automatically built for our project.

#### Create a new directory `components` to the `src` directory of out project. All of our component swill be added to this directory including and `App.js`. Storing all components in a `components` directory is considered a best practice. However, note that `index.js` should NOT be added to our new `components` directory.

## Plan your Application by drawing a component diagram using http://www.draw.oi. And include it to README.
